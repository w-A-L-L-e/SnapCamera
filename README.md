SnapCamera
==========

RoR live webcam snapshots and gallery example project. Rails version 3.2.3
This combines a flash application and some clever jQuery ajax to take live webcam snapshots on the fly and have them stored in a mysql database using
carrierwave for file and live snapshot uploading.

Tested to work in firefox, chrome and safari. Needs some extra work for IE browsers.
Posting it now because it is based on a great tutorial found on web and just rubified for my own needs...

Need some work for browsers that don't have a canvas or getElementById (like IE).
Apart from that it's really fun and easy to use. Take an instant snapshot or one in 3 seconds delay live from your cam and have it uploaded in one go to your webserver ;).
Great start for profile pages (dating, social networks etc...)
