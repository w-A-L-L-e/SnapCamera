SnapCamera
==========

RoR live webcam snapshots and gallery.
This combines a flash application and some clever jQuery ajax to take live webcam snapshots on the fly and have them stored in a mysql database using
carrierwave.

Tested to work in firefox, chrome and safari. Needs some extra work for IE browsers.
Posting it now because it is based on a great tutorial found on web and just rubified for my own needs...
